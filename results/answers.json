Players can understand the relationship between their actions and the outcomes in the game\n2. These actions and outcomes matter in the context of the larger game experience\n\nFor example, in a game like Minecraft, when I place blocks to build a shelter, I can clearly see how my actions (placing blocks) lead to an outcome (creating a safe space), and this matters because it helps me survive the night and progress in the game.
