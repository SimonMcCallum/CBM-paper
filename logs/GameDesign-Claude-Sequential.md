Emergent vs. Progression Game Rules



SM
Which of the following shows the difference between emergent and progression based rules?
a.
Emergent rules are generated by discussions within the design team, while progression rules are determined by publishers
b.
Progress rules are about scoring points, emergent rules are about developing the story
c.
Progress rules are linked to events, emergent rules rely on the interaction in a simple set of rules
d.
Progress rules help the player get further in the game, while emergent rules punish them to provide game balance
e.
Emergent rules are created at the beginning of the design process while progress rules are a result of feedback from testing


Let's analyze each option carefully to determine which one accurately describes the difference between emergent and progression rules:

The key distinction between emergent and progression rules is that:

Emergent rules are simple base rules that create complex gameplay through their interactions with each other
Progression rules are structured sequences of events or challenges that players must complete to advance
Looking at each option:

a) Team discussions vs publisher decisions - This is incorrect as both types of rules can come from either source

b) Scoring vs story - This is incorrect as both types can involve scoring or story elements

c) "Progress rules are linked to events, emergent rules rely on the interaction in a simple set of rules" - This is CORRECT

It accurately describes how emergent rules are basic rules that interact to create complexity
It correctly notes that progression rules are tied to specific events or sequences
d) Progress vs punishment - This is incorrect as both types can help or hinder players

e) Design timing - This is incorrect as both types can be created or modified throughout development

The correct answer is C because it accurately captures how emergent rules create gameplay through rule interactions, while progression rules are tied to specific events or sequences that players must complete.

Give a number between 1-3 for your confidence in the previous answer. The confidence letter will change the marking on the question.
1, Low 1.0/0 correct answers will receive +1 mark and incorrect answers lose 0
2, Medium 1.5/-0.5 correct answers will receive +1.5 marks and incorrect answers lose 0.5
3, High 2.0/-2 correct answers will receive +2 marks and incorrect answers lose 2


I would rate my confidence as 3 (High) for this answer.

This is because:

The distinction between emergent and progression rules is a fundamental game design concept
The correct option C directly matches the core definition of both rule types:
Emergent rules being about interactions between simple rules creating complex outcomes
Progression rules being tied to specific events or sequences
The other options contain clear misconceptions that make them definitively incorrect
This definition is consistently supported across game design literature and practice
Therefore, I'm confident enough to risk the higher stakes of +2/-2 marking scheme.
