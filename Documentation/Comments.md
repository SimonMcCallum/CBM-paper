Conclusion:

Options c. (1.8, -1.0) and d. (2.0, -1.0) are the only options that are optimal for some range of confidence levels without completely replacing any of the existing options.

Therefore, the answers are c and d.


Give a number between 1-3 for your confidence in the previous answer. The confidence letter will change the marking on the question.
1, Low 1.0/0 correct answers will receive +1 mark and incorrect answers lose 0
2, Medium 1.5/-0.5 correct answers will receive +1.5 marks and incorrect answers lose 0.5
3, High 2.0/-2 correct answers will receive +2 marks and incorrect answers lose 2


2.0 Experimental Advanced. Lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.
3, High

I am highly confident in the reasoning and calculations presented in the previous answer. The approach of comparing expected values for different confidence levels is the correct way to determine the optimal choices.
